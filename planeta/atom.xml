    <title>Blocking big instances might save the Fediverse</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few days ago, the new social network Threads fulfilled the promise it made a few months ago. It started testing the implementation of ActivityPub, the protocol responsible for the interoperability between all the instances of Mastodon, Pleroma, Lemmy, PixelFed (what we like to call the Fediverse).</p>

<p>Back in July, when it was announced that this new social network was planning to implement ActivityPub, the Fediverse was divided over whether to allow or to block federation with it. Now we're back in this debate. This time with the certainty that they really are doing it.</p>

<p>This whole discussion centers on the fact that Threads is yet another product of Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook, Instagram and Whastapp. In fact, to use Threads you must have an Instagram account.</p>

<p>Many of us who lurk in the Fediverse view this move by Meta with suspicion. Tech giants have a long history of adopting open protocols when they are favorable to its business and abandoning them when they have already built a big user base and don't want those to flee to other platforms. Examples abound. The most famous are those of the RSS protocol, abandoned by Google Reader, and the XMPP/Jabber protocol, abandoned by Google Talk and Facebook Messenger.</p>

<p>There's little doubt that the same could happen with ActivityPub. If Meta is currently considering adopting it, it's because they think they can get some commercial benefit from it. But if this strategy doesn't work, if they reach the conclusion that it is in fact detrimental to their financial health, the protocol will certainly be abandoned.</p>

<p>Many fear that this could happen, that the Fediverse will become too dependent on a single instance where most of the users host their accounts.</p>

<p>Many even think that that is in fact Meta's big evil plan. They will enter the Fediverse, build a big user base and abandon it, leaving all the other users wishing they were on Threads so they can continue to interact with the majority of their contacts. But does that make any sense? Just a few hours after Threads was launched, it already had more users than the entire Fediverse. Why would they want to extinguish something that can't stand up to them?</p>

<p>We all know in fact who their main rival is: Twitter, the social network that launched the concept of microblogging but has become a nightmare after being acquired by its new billionaire last year . And yes, there is also another potential competitor: BlueSky, the new social network launched by the former billionaire of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. It was supposedly designed from the start to be decentralized, but so far this has been nothing more than promises.</p>

<p>Maybe this whole adoption of ActivityPub thing is some kind of plan is to win this space. I have no idea. But I know they're not doing it just because they believe in decentralization. If they did believe, why haven't they implemented it on Facebook or Instagram? Why do we even need an account to read posts from those platforms? Why don't they make their users' posts available via RSS so that we can follow them without accessing their platform (as Mastodon does)? Possibly because those products already are market leaders and they don't want to mess around with them. In fact, if any other promising competing products show up, they are quickly acquired.</p>

<p>A very interesting feature of Mastodon is the ease with which you can migrate an account from one server to another, bringing all the followers from the old account to the new one. According to Eugen Rochko (Gargron), Mastodon's creator, his "<a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/111591822065763831">wife is looking forward to deleting her Instagram account once she can connect with the same folks from her Mastodon account. Being able to remain in touch with over 100M people who still use Meta products out of the comfort of an ad-free, privacy-friendly platform like Mastodon is a game changer</a>". </p>

<p>What Gargron doesn't tell us is how he expects that to happen. First of all, ActivityPub is being tested on Threads, not Instagram. But let's imagine that Instagram goes down that road too. Can you imagine Instagram implementing an account migration feature that allows its users to move away to a Mastodon instance? I can see it happening in the opposite direction, sure. But believing that Meta will allow any celebrity to leave its platform while keeping their millions of followers, is totally naive. </p>

<p>Even if they did allow it, and if they somehow managed to monetize posts from other servers, it would still be a huge risk if those celebrities' followers also decided to migrate to the same server where the "cool people" are now.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. Why am I so critical of Meta's plan, when I've always been and advocate for interoperability? And, like me, why are so many other defenders of open protocols wary of federation with Threads? Isn't it contradictory that, now that this platform is going to adopt one of those protocols, we are so suspicious and thinking of blocking it in our accounts and on our servers? Aren't we the ones who compare ActivityPub with SMTP, the successful protocol that allows email to also be a decentralized and federated system?</p>

<p>Well, when we advocate the adoption of open protocols, what we're really saying is that anyone with some technical ability can create and manage a server. If so many people can do it, then the existence of servers that hold a majority of users is completely unnecessary. There are currently thousands of Mastodon servers (<a href="https://instances.social">instances.social</a> currently lists almost 17,000). Most of those only have a few dozen users. This is what we call decentralization. It's the possibility for a community to have its own corner of the Internet, free and independent of the big tech infrastructure. <strong>On the other hand, if a majority of users are centered on a single server, can we really call that decentralization?</strong></p>

<p>I've thought about this a lot and I believe that the way forward is to block any instance that becomes a threat to the existence of the Fediverse by accumulating a significant percentage of users. <strong>I'm not only talking about Threads, Instagram, Twitter, Tik Tok, etc. I'm saying that we should also block any instance of Mastodon that grows beyond a reasonable size.</strong> Yes, Gargron, we're keeping an eye on your instance, too. Just like we block instances with hateful content, we should block any instance that may be toxic to the environment. That means blocking ones that are, or have become, bigger than they should be.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, and going back to the email analogy, we don't want another Gmail. We want diversity.</strong></p>

<p>But, unfortunately, not everyone agrees with blocking these platforms, which means that the Fediverse is split between blocking and non-blocking instances. In the latter, users will be able to interact with those trapped in Threads. In the former, this won't be possible. </p>

<p>Perhaps some users will migrate from the blocking instances to permissive ones where they will be able to follow Cristiano Ronaldo or Kim Kardashian's posts. I'd rather look at the bright side of it and enjoy that some other people will choose to delete their big tech social accounts and move to smaller instances where they will be able to interact with the many interesting people and communities who have chosen to keep control of their own data and posts.</p>

<p>Blocking is taking care of our space. It means keeping it healthy and free from manipulative algorithms, targeted advertising and dark patterns. Blocking is the best way to send out the message that we're fine as we are and don't need Zuckerbergs or Musks to get what, after all, we already have.</p>

    <title>MiniDebConf Portugal 2023</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><img alt="a rooster of Barcelos surrounded by Debian's swirl: MiniDebConf Portugal's logo" src="https://pt2023.mini.debconf.org/media/pages_files/miniDebConf_logo_chicken_swirl-twocolor3-plain-smaller.svg" title=""/></p>

<p>I've been a Debian user for a long time, but I've always sought (and felt the
lack of) some sort of impulse to be more involved with Debian. Part of it, I
suppose, was the lack of someone 'closer' (not necessarily, but also physically
close) following the same path, or pushing in the same direction...  Anyway,
once in a while I did find some opportunities to do something about it: in 2008
I helped organize <a href="https://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/2008/04/tecnonov-2008-tomorrow-fnac-coimbra.html">Tecnonov
2008</a>
where not only we had a Debian Developer talking about the project, we also had
a key-signing party (and I got my now expired key signed by the DD in
question). The year later, I went to Aveiro for <a href="https://www.debian.org/events/2009/0801-debianday-pt">Debian Day PT
2009</a>, but... well, that
was so long ago that the t-shirt I've got there has already been recycled!</p>

<p>It was thanks to <a href="https://sintra2019.ubucon.org/">Ubucon Europe 2019</a> in Sintra
that I've learned for the first time that there was an ongoing attempt to being
DebianDay to Portugal... and finally, in 2023, a "local test" is being
organized, a <a href="https://pt2023.mini.debconf.org/">MiniDebConf in Lisbon</a> that
will, hopefully, also serve as a step towards a future <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/25">DebConf in
Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>I have to confess, the younger me of ten, or the even younger me of twenty
years ago would be a lot more excited with this, but still, it is finally
happening, so how could I not attend? So here I am: with time off taken from
work, hotel room reserved, ready for a week of Debian (and more generically
free software) along likeminded individuals. I've even decided to contribute
more actively and give <a href="https://pt2023.mini.debconf.org/users/marado/">a talk and a
workshop</a>...</p>

<p>It starts already this sunday, and it lasts until thursday. See you there?</p>

    <title>O voto eletrónico e a memória selectiva</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Escrevi uma <a href="https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1621539780633804806">thread no
twitter</a> porque é
lá que está o Grupo Parlamentar do Partido Socialista... mas aparentemente a
menção não os taggou (quem sabe porquê, hoje e dia o twitter tem tantas falhas
que não sei que isto é bug ou feature)... De qualquer forma, se não é para
encetar diálogo com eles, vale mais deixar o registo aqui.</p>

<p>Hoje deparei-me com uma
<a href="https://observador.pt/2023/02/01/ps-recomenda-ao-governo-experiencia-de-voto-eletronico-para-emigrantes/">notícia</a>
que referia que o Grupo Parlamentar do PS apresentou um <a href="https://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/DetalheIniciativa.aspx?BID=152371">projecto de
resolução</a>
a recomendar ao Governo a adoptar o voto eletrónico.  Não é de espantar, a
promessa estava feita no <a href="https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1509960038848372737">Programa de
Governo</a>, mas o
que ainda me consegue espantar é... a deliberada - tem de ser propositada! -
memória selectiva que o PS, Governo ou Grupo Parlamentar, pratica sem
cerimónia, assumindo que os Portugueses tenham memória muito curta (os
jornalistas, pelo menos, aparentam tê-la).</p>

<p>Refiro-me ao facto de todo o preâmbulo e justificação para esta adoção proposta
se baseie, fundamentalmente, num pressuposto, numa etapa que "demonstra" que
este é o certeiro próximo passo... a experiência de Évora.  De acordo com este
projecto, Évora foi uma "experiência bem sucedida", e isso faz com que tudo o
resto faça sentido - o voto eletrónico servirá para "tornar o processo de
votação mais simples e cada vez mais fiável".</p>

<p>O problema deste conto de fadas não é que ele é sujeito à opinião, não é que há
quem ache que sim e há quem ache que não. Não é sequer que <a href="https://tilde.pt/~marado/blog/voto-electronico-em-portugal---mais-do-que-um-problema-tecnico-um-problema-legal.html">o voto eletrónico
não é compatível com o nosso sistema
eleitoral</a>.
O problema é que <strong>a experiência de Évora foi um desastre</strong>.</p>

<p>Não precisam de se fiar em mim, foi a CNPD que o disse.  "Protecção de Dados
arrasa voto eletrónico", foi o título no Público, enquanto a TSF dizia que "Até
o secretismo ficou em causa. Parecer arrasa experiência de voto eletrónico
promovida pelo Governo". O problema não foi um, nem foi um molho de coisas
pouco graves. Não. Houve falta de anonimato no voto. Máquinas com selos
rasgados. Depois do voto houve acesso aos dados. Num inúmero conjunto de
problemas, a Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados enlencou várias falhas que
classificou de inadmissíveis. Não foram só coisas que podiam ser usadas para
motivos nefastos, foram também coisas que aconteceram - discrepâncias no número
de votos contabilizados em três mesas de voto distintas, por exemplo. Enfim, é
um <a href="https://t.co/42V1QRN2IT">relatório de 31 páginas</a> que descrevem um sistema
que nunca, de forma alguma, sob seja que prisma for, se pode considerar "bem
sucedido".</p>

<p>Perante as evidências que vão contra aquilo que o PS gostaria que tivessem sido
os resultados, que faz o PS? Ignora o relatório da CNPD, inventa toda uma nova
realidade, finje que as coisas são diferentes que são, e continuam a puxar a
sua agenda. Os factos alternativos chegaram a Portugal, e, espantosamente, o
partido que está por detrás disso é o Partido Socialista.</p>

<p>Os Portugueses merecem melhor.</p>

    <link href="https://tilde.pt/~epifanio/blog/hacking-a-custom-homepage-for-your-mastodon-instance.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Hacking a custom homepage for your Mastodon instance</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Starting with version 4.0.0, Mastodon's homepage is not that great. It defaults to the "explore" page that basically shows the public timeline of that instance. If you want to know more you have to click on the "Learn more" button and then you're presented with the about page that shows the long description of the instance, the rules and the list of moderated servers. And it all shows up in a column centered on the page, which is kinda limiting.</p>

<p>You can add some html tags to the description of the instance. That is good. But you can't do it in the rules section, where you can't even add hyperlinks.</p>

<p>In our instance, Ciberlândia, we decided to hack a custom homepage:</p>

<p><a href="https://ciberlandia.pt">https://ciberlandia.pt</a></p>

<p>Looks good, doesn't it? <a href="https://ciberlandia.pt/@aiscarvalho">aiscarvalho</a> and <a href="https://ciberlandia.pt/@rlafuente">rlafuente</a> did a great work with the design of the page.</p>

<p>We didn't want to mess with the Mastodon source code, so we did it all by hacking a few rules in the NGINX config.</p>

<h4>First step: Create your homepage html</h4>

<p>SSH to your server as the <code>mastodon</code> user (or <code>sudo - mastodon</code> if you're already logged in as root).</p>

<p>Create the directory where your html will be. We used <code>/home/mastodon/live/custom-index/</code>. Put your index.html, images and css files in there.</p>

<h4>Second step: Add rules to NGINX config</h4>

<p>In this step you have to be logged in as root.</p>

<p>Edit the file <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon</code> and add these lines (don't forget to change you Content-Security-Policy according to your needs):</p>

<pre><code># START CUSTOM HOMEPAGE

location /welcome {
  rewrite ^ /welcome/ redirect;
}

location /welcome/ {
  alias /home/mastodon/live/custom-index/;
  add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; font-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'";
  add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload';
  add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
}

location = / {                                                             
  if ($cookie__session_id = "") {
    rewrite ^/$ https://&lt;**your instance url in here**&gt;/welcome/ redirect;
  }                                                                                                                                                      
  try_files $uri @proxy;                                                   
}                                   

# END CUSTOM HOMEPAGE
</code></pre>

<h4>Final step: restart NGINX</h4>

<p>Run this:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl restart nginx
</code></pre>

<p>Now when a user tries to access the root of your site, NGINX will check if the user is logged in (checking the value of the cookie session_id) and redirect them to your custom page which is located at the /welcome/ path.</p>

<p>If the user is logged in, they will of course be served the default Mastodon interface.</p>

<p>[EDIT 2023-03-12] Added security headers</p>

    <title>Bots de Mastodon: o que são, como fazer, e a botiqueta</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Tecnicamente, um bot é uma conta que publica toots automaticamente, seja de
forma regular ou em reacção a determinados sinais.</p>

<p>Na prática, são tão mais do que isso. A possibilidade de fazermos
mini-máquinas de publicação automática veio mostrar-nos o seu potencial
prático, humorístico, artístico, humano e até poético. Existe até <a href="https://botsin.space">uma
instância</a> dedicada exclusivamente a bots.</p>

<h2>Os que por aí andam</h2>

<p>Há os bots ferramenta que podemos mencionar para fazerem algo por nós, como
imortalizar citações, reconhecer o texto de uma imagem ou aplicar filtros em
fotografias.</p>

<p>Existem também bots que publicam regularmente textos gerados de forma mais ou
menos aleatória, que vão das experiências mais simples até demonstrações
notáveis de criatividade e escrita conceptual -- sobre isto, as obras da
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8x8ppp/poetry-twitter-bots-best-twitter-bots-art-allison-parrish-everyword">Allison
Parrish</a>
e do <a href="https://tinysubversions.com">Darius
Kazemi</a>
são imperdíveis. E se formos para além do texto, há <a href="https://botsin.space/@tinymazes/109559792625314084">resultados
deliciosos</a>.</p>

<p>Finalmente há os bots que publicam de acordo com fontes externas, re-publicando
<a href="https://botsin.space/@skcfdispatches">alertas e emergências</a>, <a href="https://botsin.space/@ValeWeather/109559792640324813">previsões do
tempo</a>; ou então, ligados
a API mais sofisticadas, dá para jogar <a href="https://botsin.space/@VoteChess/109559765073122881">xadrez por
votação</a> ou <a href="https://botsin.space/@AboveSigingstone/109559732702433116">detectar
aviões</a> a passar por
cima de uma certa localidade.</p>

<p>(esta não é de todo uma taxonomia formal ou sequer séria; se tiveres outras
ideias sobre como discriminar entre tipos de bots, gostava de ouvir)</p>

<h2>Como fazer um</h2>

<p>Existem recursos para criar bots sem recorrer a código; no Twitter havia vários
que nunca realmente explorei, porque com Python dá para fazer tudo. No Mastodon
ainda não me sentei para andar à procura, mas gostava de saber o que por aí há.</p>

<p>Sujar as mãos com código dá-nos outro tipo de superpoderes. Para pôr a
rolar um bot, precisas de acesso a uma shell; podes aproveitar um computador
que tenhas sempre ligado, ou então usar um serviço que te dê acesso a uma shell
SSH. Os comandos aqui destinam-se a sistemas GNU/Linux, mas devem também
funcionar em Mac (não me perguntem pelo Windows).</p>

<p>Começamos por instalar localmente o módulo que nos dá os poderes de interagir
com a API da tua instância. Há várias formas de instalar o <a href="https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">módulo do
Mastodon</a>, como num Virtualenv,
mas esta é a mais simples e rápida:</p>

<pre><code>pip install --user mastodon.py
</code></pre>

<p>Depois, cria um ficheiro <code>bot.py</code> e cola este pequeno pedaço de código:</p>

<pre><code>from mastodon import Mastodon
mastodon = Mastodon(access_token=MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN,
                    api_base_url=MASTODON_API_BASE_URL)
mastodon.status_post(text, visibility='unlisted')
</code></pre>

<p>É tudo o que é preciso! Vamos por partes:</p>

<ul>
<li>depois de importar, criamos o objecto <code>mastodon</code> que podemos usar para
interagir com a API do Mastodon</li>
<li>substitui o campo <code>MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN</code> pelo token de acesso que te foi dado 
quando registaste a aplicação na API da tua instância</li>
<li>substitui o campo <code>MASTODON_API_BASE_URL</code> pelo endereço da instância</li>
<li>o post é feito com a visibilidade não-listada para não interferir com as
timelines locais -- já explico melhor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finalmente, coloca o script a correr regularmente num <em>cronjob</em>; corre o
comando <code>crontab -e</code> e acrescenta a linha</p>

<pre><code>@hourly /path/para/o/teu/bot.py
</code></pre>

<p>E está a rolar! Antes de activares o cron, corre o script um par de vezes para
assegurar que está bem.</p>

<h2>Botiqueta</h2>

<p>Há uns anos a <a href="https://tilde.pt/~aiscarvalho">~aiscarvalho</a> e eu demos um workshop de bots de
Mastodon (e de Twitter, mas passado é passado). Éramos uma dúzia a criar
geradores de texto e fomos para o masto.pt pôr os nossos bots a cantar, o que
arreliou bastante o <a href="https://masto.pt/@hugo">administrador da instância</a>: ele
tratou de silenciar os nossos bots porque estavam a poluir a timeline local. À
primeira ficámos irritados, então estávamos a trazer coisas tão giras e vêm
logo assim. Mas depois lá concordámos que devíamos ter perguntado primeiro,
pedimos desculpa e fomos ler sobre isso das timelines locais.</p>

<p>A timeline local é o ponto de cada instância onde se podem ler todos os toots
públicos feitos por pessoas que dela fazem parte. É um sítio especialmente bom
se estiveres numa instância temática, regional ou local, porque se encontram
facilmente novas contas a seguir, e dá para conversas mais recatadas.</p>

<p>Ora, se um bot começa a emitir um ou mais toots a cada hora, começa a dominar
a timeline local e a dificultar a leitura do resto, obrigando cada pessoa a
silenciá-lo individualmente. Daí na maioria das instâncias existirem normas
sobre toots não-listados -- as situações onde se deve evitar fazer toots
públicos, como nos vários toots de um thread (o primeiro deve ser público, os
seguintes não-listados) e quando existe política de bots, é quase sempre
imposto que não façam toots públicos.</p>

<p>Este é o primeiro ponto do que tentámos condensar na Ciberlândia como as boas
práticas de construção de bots:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apenas fazer toots não-listados</li>
<li>Assinalar no perfil que a conta é um bot (há uma opção para isso)</li>
<li>Se o bot fizer upload de imagens e vídeos, contacta os admins da instância</li>
</ol>

<p>O ponto 2 serve para discriminar os tipos de conta nas estatísticas da
instância e permitir distinguir claramente quando uma conta é um bot.</p>

<p>O ponto 3 prende-se com as duras realidades do alojamento: afixar um vídeo de
2MB por dia dá 730 MB por ano, o que é um peso razoável na conta mensal de
alojamento. Os admins da tua instância podem ajudar-te a encontrar
alternativas de alojamento ou métodos de compressão que possam facilitar a vida
a todos os envolvidos.</p>

<h2>Portugal adopta o bot</h2>

<p>Na <a href="https://ciberlandia.pt">Ciberlândia</a> damos as boas-vindas a bots
interessantes, criativos e/ou úteis.  Se tiveres interesse na arte de engendrar
estas geringonças de publicação automática, há espaço para experimentar e gente
por perto para tirar dúvidas.</p>

<p>E se souberes de bots interessantes em português ou outras formas promissoras de
engendrar bots, <a href="https://ciberlandia.pt/@rlafuente">manda-me um toot</a>. (o mesmo
para erros que possa ter feito e sugestões técnicas!)</p>

<p>Celebrating the shortest?/longest? night (depending on where you are in the
world), this year's Club Tidal solsice party is going to be a
<a href="https://sun.tidalcycles.org/">24 hours festival</a>, and my solo musical project
<a href="https://merankorii.blogspot.com/">Merankorii</a> is going to participate by
playing Cycle #35 (if you're in Portugal, that will be at 21:20, on December
21).</p>

<p>As some of you know, Yule is when my birthday also is, so this is a special
celebration for me...</p>

<p>This online festival is going to be live streamed, so make sure to tune in
during this 24h period and celebrate the Solstice by witnessing to people from
all over the world livecoding sounds for your pleasure! </p>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Já ao tempo que quero tirar o pó a este blog e voltar à prática de escrever
publicamente sem complexos.</p>

<p>E claro, já vão meses desde que a vontade está aí, mas já explorei meia dúzia
de estruturas de post e terminar algo fica sempre para o dia seguinte.</p>

<p>Por isso zás, segue este post para desbloquear e espero que resulte.</p>

    <title>Breve Introdução ao git, gitlab e github</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Todos os anos em Outubro acontece o
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>: um evento que funciona como um
concurso, em que se incentiva e promove a colaboração em projectos de Software
Livre.</p>

<p>Tal como no ano passado, a <a href="https://ansol.org">ANSOL</a> está a promover e
facilitar a participação ao Hacktoberfest, apoio esse que vai ser pontuado com
alguns eventos ao longo do mês.</p>

<p>Para começar, vou amanhã (dia 13 de Outubro, às 22h) fazer uma apresentação
introdutória sobre <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, ferramenta que é utilizada no
Hacktoberfest, ainda que maioritariamente focando na sua utilização nas
plataformas <a href="https://gitlab.com">gitlab</a> ou <a href="https://github.com">github</a> - que
são as usadas no evento.</p>

<p><img alt="cartaz do evento" src="https://ansol.org/eventos/2022-10-13-hacktoberfest/poster.png" title=""/></p>

<p>Assim, estão todos convidados a
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hacktoberfest:ansol.org">assistir</a> a esta pequena
apresentação online e gratuita, mesmo que não tenham interesse em depois
participar no Hacktoberfest.</p>

Estou de regresso à escrita, e à Ficção Científica.

Desta vez, participo com um pequeno conto para o livro "Lamego 2022 - o antes e o depois", uma colectânia de textos nos mais variados formatos e estilos, que olha para a cidade onde nasci - não só como ela é hoje, mas na sua História passada e história futura.
<p/>
O lançamento deste livro vai ser já no próximo dia 5 de Junho, enquadrado no festival "<a href="https://www.cm-lamego.pt/home/noticias/1909-lamego-cidade-poema-regressa-ao-formato-presencial">Lamego Cidade Poema</a>".

    <title>O Voto Eletrónico e o Solucionismo Tecnológico</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>"No estrangeiro, os portugueses votam principalmente por voto postal", diz a <a href="https://comunidadeslusofonas.pt/associacao-tsp-defende-que-voto-digital-e-a-solucao-para-os-problemas-do-atual-sistema-eleitoral/">TSP</a>, sublinhando que "este sistema já funcionava mal em vários países", mas que nas últimas eleições "não chegou praticamente nenhum voto da África do Sul", e que agora com a pandemia "o sistema postal está próximo do colapso em países tão evoluídos como o Reino Unido".</p>

<p>Então: nós que andamos nisto da democracia já há alguns aninhos, ainda não conseguimos fazer um sistema de voto por correspondência a funcionar decentemente. Um problema que tem, como solução, corrigir os problemas do sistema de voto postal, certo? Errado! Para a TSP - que aproveita para nos dar mais alguns detalhes sobre o que se passa com a proposta do voto electrónico remoto para as eleicões do CCP (agora sabemos que está a ser um trabalho conjunto do MAI, a AMA e o MNE) - a solução não é corrigir um sistema de fácil compreensão e tecnologia provada como o sistema de voto por correspondência, mas sim o voto eletrónico remoto.</p>

<p>Defendem que "Portugal é um país inovador e com técnicos de nível mundial, que podem produzir um sistema de voto eletrónico remoto seguro, testado e auditável", (sem dizer onde se basearam para fazer tal afirmação). Ficamos sem entender porque é que, se temos assim tão boas capacidades técnicas, como é que o voto por correspondência funciona tão mal - como é que <a href="https://www.publico.pt/2019/09/27/politica/noticia/cerca-39-mil-boletins-voto-devolvidos-estrangeiro-votacao-1888153">não temos a morada certa dos eleitores</a>, <a href="https://observador.pt/2019/10/17/35-mil-votos-nulos-no-estrangeiro-mudancas-no-voto-postal-baralharam-emigrantes/">não sabemos explicar como se vota</a> e nem sequer <a href="https://www.jn.pt/nacional/canal/legislativas-2019/emigrantes-alertam-boletim-de-voto-nao-cabe-no-envelope-11318936.html">preparar boletins que caibam nos envelopes</a>. Mas sim, vamos entregar-lhes a preparação de um sistema de voto electrónico, remoto, seguro, anónimo, fiável. O que pode correr mal?</p>

    <title>Happy 20th birthday, ANSOL!</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today we celebrated the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://ansol.org">ANSOL</a>, the Portuguese Free Software Association. It has been an honor to be part of the history of this still young association, and here's hope for an active 20 years more - I'll gladly celebrate its 40th!</p>

<p><img alt="Image of the round table where I've participated" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBQ8TBoWYAAh7LR?format=jpg&amp;name=large" title=""/></p>

<p>In these past 20 years, ANSOL worked on many issues, but if I had to highlight 3, I'd point out:</p>

<ul>
<li>the fight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_directive_on_the_patentability_of_computer-implemented_inventions#Opponents_of_the_proposal">against Software Patents in Europe</a> - which stopped (or stalled?) software patents;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.dn.pt/opiniao/opiniao-dn/convidados/normas-abertas-fantasmas-e-a-formula-midi-1776429.html">Open Standards Law in Portugal</a> - ahead of the curve;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20191113-01.en.html">Portuguese anti-DRM law</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But there are many more challenges ahead... and our victories aren't closed books.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Unified Patent Court in Europe is <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/only-one-more-ratification-needed-4189294/">about to become a reality</a>, and with it Software Patents;</li>
<li>The Open Standards Law in Portugal exists, but <a href="https://shifter.pt/2021/02/lei-das-normas-abertas/">in practice it is isn't being actually applied</a>;</li>
<li>And while we have a good protection against DRM in law (as far as we can within the EU, thanks to InfoSoc), there is now a <a href="https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1443250573147623424">covert attempt to water it down</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what now? Well, there is plenty to do: we should ensure we don't loose the Freedoms we have achieved, and we should strive to get those we still didn't get.</p>

<p><em>There is plenty more to do, and you can help.</em></p>

<p>If you're in Portugal, <a href="https://ansol.org/inscricao">join ANSOL</a>. If you're in Europe, FSFE will appreciate your <a href="https://fsfe.org/contribute/contribute.en.html">contribution</a>. If you're in Latin America, <a href="http://fsfla.org/ikiwiki/about/participate.en.html">here's your link</a>. In India, join <a href="https://fsf.org.in/volunteer/">here</a>. Based in North America, with worldwide mission, there's <a href="https://fsf.org/associate/">FSF</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, as we could see in those who have joined ANSOL in today's celebration, there is plenty beyond the realm of software. Consider getting to know <a href="https://pt.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Portugal</a> or the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, <a href="https://direitosdigitais.pt/">Direitos Digitais</a> in Portugal and <a href="https://edri.org/">EDRI</a> in Europe or <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> overseas.</p>

<p>Let's shape the future, together.</p>

<p>«From the Preface: "This is a translation of an old book—indeed, in Internet time, it is a translation of an ancient text." That text is Lessig's "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace." The second version of that book is "Code v2." The aim of Code v2 is to update the earlier work, making its argument more relevant to the current internet.»</p>

    <title>Are Cassette tapes dead? (again)</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Tired of reading people saying that one or another mature technology was dead,
ten years ago I decided to act upon one of those claims (saying that cassette
tapes were dead) and <a href="https://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/2011/05/stop-claiming-is-dead.html">write a blog
post</a>,
where, using the data available on Discogs, I made a graph showing the
percentage of cassette releases related to all of the releases on that
database.</p>

<p>That blog post had more success than I thought would have, with some people,
once in a while, wondering how were things progressing (not only regarding the
cassette tapes market on current days, but also the growth of discogs' database
and its knowledge of past releases). I did update the graph a few times since
the initial blog post, but today, to mark the 10th anniversary of the initial
post, I decided to <a href="https://github.com/marado/discogs-tape-releases">actually write a script that automatically generates such a
graphic</a>, and generate one of
those graphs, once again.</p>

<p>And, guess what!, turns out cassette tapes aren't dead, or even dying.</p>

    <title>O manifesto das cebolas na era da transição digital</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Ocorre-me com regularidade que eu escrevo demasidos comentários em redes sociais efémeras por natureza, ideais que rapidamente se perdem em eternos scrolls. Este é um texto que escrevi numa <a href="https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1392049035867983872">thread no twitter</a> e que agora republico aqui, para mais fácil guardar para a posteridade.</em></p>

<p>Em 2012, a ANSOL - Associação Nacional para o Software Livre, lançou o seu <a href="https://ansol.org/manifesto/campo-das-cebolas">manifesto do campo das cebolas</a>. Aí criticava o esbanjar de dinheiros públicos na aquisição - frequentemente ilegal - de software.   </p>

<p>A ESOP - Associação de Empresas de Software Open Source Portuguesas, fez de um desses contratos exemplo: <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.pt/2014/03/14/esop-denuncia-aumento-de-concursos-publicos-ilegais/">levou a Câmara Municipal de Almada a tribunal e ganhou</a>. Mas de que serve uma vitória, num caso, se a prática se mantém?</p>

<p>Em 2013, observaram um aumento de 143% no valor destes contratos ilegais. Tinha já, entretanto, entrado em funcionamento o mecanismo de pareceres prévios da AMA. Ainda assim...</p>

<p>Em 2017, numa <a href="https://www.publico.pt/2017/04/09/politica/investigacao/europa-a-colonia-digital-dos-eua-1767844">investigação do Público</a>, chega-se à conclusão que, neste aspecto, nada mudou para melhor. Diz-se, então, que esta prática "deveria merecer uma acção da Comissão Europeia." Hoje fala-se de transição digital, mas sobre isto nada foi feito.</p>

<p>Hoje lembrei-me disto, porque alguém reclamava deste contrato, em que o <a href="http://dre.pt/application/file/a/163047108">SNS gasta perto de 300 mil euro em licenças de Office 365</a>. Dir-me-ão que o SNS, agora, não tem alternativa noutro fornecedor. Já estava previsto no manifesto da ANSOL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"provavelmente dirão que não têm conhecimento de alternativas ou que têm conhecimento mas não têm capacidade para as implementar e gerir. Ou pior, dirão que devido às decisões que eles mesmo tomaram no passado - que os deixaram enredados num esparguete de dependências"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mas, convém sublinhar, também diz o manifesto das cebolas, "quem paga somos nós", e há alternativa.</p>

<p>Estes milhões são nossos. Até quando estaremos dispostos a esbanjá-los assim?</p>

    <title>Voto electrónico em Portugal - mais do que um problema técnico, um problema legal</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>O debate do voto electrónico tem décadas, mas, ainda que a investigação na área tenha apresentado evoluções, a discussão sobre a temática nem por isso. Pilotos atrás de pilotos, e tentativas de implementar o voto electrónico em Portugal vieram e falharam, mas pode-se sempre apontar o dedo a uma coisa: uma fraca implementação. Esse problema tem duas facetas: se, por um lado, aqueles que se opõe na generalidade ao voto electrónico têm uma forma fácil de apontar o dedo à má impementação e dizer "vêm?, não presta!", esse argumento acaba por não convencer aqueles que são a favor do voto electrónico, com o argumento de que "lá porque este foi mal feito, não quer dizer que não se possa fazer bem".</p>

<p>Também foi assim nas últimas Europeias, que em Portugal incluiram um piloto de voto de electrónico, que correu francamente mal - porque (adivinhe-se) tinha uma implementação má. Mas se a experiência serviu para alguma coisa, no que diz respeito à comunicação social e ao debate político, foi para por o tema outra vez na agenda política, e nunca se falou em portugal sobre o voto electrónico como hoje. Em vez que servir como prova de que o voto electrónico é uma má ideia, o exemplo serviu para aguçar apetites.</p>

<p>Mas, para o debate - se alguém o quiser efectivamente ter, e de forma séria - sobre a implementação de um sistema de voto electrónico em Portugal, o melhor contributo deste exemplo piloto que tivemos foi o post-mortem feito pela CNPD. O documento, que fez headlines nos jornais, e que demonstra que a implementação da solução usada era má, foi, mais uma vez, usado por vários como ponto de partida para dizer "a solução é má, mas podem haver boas." Contudo, parece-me, quem diz isso não olhou para o documento como um todo.</p>

<p>O <a href="https://t.co/42V1QRN2IT">parecer da CNPD</a> é uma leitura no total interessante, mas há um segmento em particular que me parecem muito útil. Mas, para quem pensava que ia ler um artigo a falar blockchain ou de consenso bizantino... lamento. O excerto do parecer que me parece valer a pena destacar é o que demonstra que o problema do voto electrónico em Portugal é, mais do que um problema técnico, um problema legal. Não me refiro à parte que diz "qualquer solução precisa de ser legislada exaustivamente, o que não tem acontecido" (o que é verdade, mas é resolúvel apenas com a criação de mais legislação), mas sim à parte que diz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a questão da transparência elencada no n.º 1 do artigo 5.º do RGPD tem de ser tida à luz da possibilidade de os titulares dos dados (leia-se "eleitores") poderem compreender, de forma completa (ainda que não exaustiva), como decorrem as operações de tratamento que incidem sobre os seus dados pessoais, entre as quais se encontra a votação.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>É importante, porque declara que, à luz do RGPD (em vigor não só em Portugal mas nos diversos estados membros), obriga-se a que um sistema eleitoral - que por natureza lida com eleitores e seus votos - seja compreensível pela generalidade dos eleitores, coisa que não pode acontecer num sistema da complexidade exida por um sistema fiável de voto electrónico.</p>

<p>A CNPD aponta para o exemplo da Alemanha, em que este conflicto entre os sistemas de voto electrónico e a compreensão pelo cidadão comum do seu funcionamento foi levado ao seu Tribunal Constitucional, levando à decisão de não implementação de voto electrónico, mas não é só na Alemanha que esta questão precede o RGPD. No texto da associação <a href="https://direitosdigitais.pt/comunicacao/noticias/76-vamos-reflectir-sobre-o-voto-electronico">D3 - Defesa dos Direitos Digitais - sobre o voto electrónico</a>, escrito em antecipação às europeias - quando a última experiência de voto electrónico decorreu em Portugal - lê-se:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>todo o cidadão deve poder compreender ele próprio o funcionamento do sistema eleitoral do país, qualquer que seja o sistema,  por forma a ter suficiente confiança de que este está em conformidade com a lei. Uma solução digital será sempre uma solução demasiado complexa, mesmo para os eleitores mais esclarecidos, o que irá inevitavelmente trazer desconfiança ao processo legislativo e aos seus resultados por parte de quem tenha resultados inferiores ao que esperava.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mas será assim? Bem, em Portugal existem vários actos eleitorais, cada um com a sua Legislação aplicável. Temos, por exemplo, na Lei Eleitoral dos Órgãos das Autarquias Locais (que rege as Autárquicas que em breve decorrerão em território nacional), o Artigo 52.º que diz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cabe à Comissão Nacional de Eleições promover, através de meios de comunicação social, públicos e privados, o esclarecimento objectivo dos cidadãos sobre o significado das eleições para a vida do País, sobre o processo eleitoral e sobre o processo de votação.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terá a CNE os meios necessários para cumprir tal artigo - no que diz respeito ao esclarecimento objectivo sobre o processo eleitoral - se o processo for por via electrónica?</p>

<h3>Em jeito de conclusão</h3>

<p>Tem-se discutido cada vez mais sobre o voto electrónico em Portugal. Contudo, tem-se falado do tema como se ele fosse maioritariamente um desafio técnico, quando, a meu ver, os entraves são legislativos. Não estou a defender que o "direito ao esclarecimento" deve ser posto de parte, mas acredito que é aí que o debate se deve centrar. A legislação actualmente em vigor - tanto nacional como comunitária - defende esse direito ao esclarecimento, que é incompatível com um sistema de voto electrónico(1). Acredito que haja quem ache que ter voto electrónico é mais importante - mas então é esse o argumento que deve ser feito por quem assim o acha, em particular devendendo as alterações legislativas necessárias. Esse debate pode trazer algum fruto. O técnico, parece-me, está ao mesmo nível em 2021 que estava há duas décadas atrás, e assim continuará.</p>

      <h1>FluConf 2026 submission</h1>
	  This is the submission description for FluConf 2026.
	  <p>
	  FluConf has showed up as an alternative to FOSDEM, but at the same time there is the concept of "Open Source Week", gathering not only FOSDEM but information about the 'fringe events' that always happen in the week before of after FOSDEM. I had not prepared anything for FluConf, but as I went through the <a href="https://opensourceweek.eu/">Open Source Week</a> website I felt like I needed to rant... and it occurred to me that with the variety of submission formats allowed to FluConf, a 'rant poem' could be a nice fit.
	  <p>
	  The poem is short, so instead of describing it for the submission, I'll ask you to read it. If this submission is accepted, I plan to just remove this section from the page, leaving the rest of the page as is in time for FluConf.

	  <h1>This Week's Poem</h1>
<pre>
I went to the "<a href="https://opensourceweek.eu/">Open Source Week</a>" website for 2026
And saw several online events:
One told me to join a "Teams Community",
Another asked me to "Join on Zoom!"
Some events were invite only,
Others you'll need to be there,
But I scrolled and scrolled,
Until I reached the page's footer,
And remained with nothing planned for the week.

So, instead, I wrote this.
It might not be good poetry
But at least you can read it with Free Software.
How's that for an "Open Source Week" read?

In the epilogue I end as I started:
thinking I'll enjoy FluConf 2026,
just like I did FluConf 2025.

	  <h2>FluConf 2026</h2>
	  <a href=".">I</a> really enjoyed FluConf 2025 (specially <a href="https://librecast.net/fluconf-2025/">Brett's presentation</a> that kicked off the program), so it is a pleasure to actively participate in FluConf 2026, even if it is just with this short and silly poem. Make sure to check out <a href="https://2026.fluconf.online/">FluConf 2026</a>'s website where I'm sure you'll be able to find way more interesting submissions than this!

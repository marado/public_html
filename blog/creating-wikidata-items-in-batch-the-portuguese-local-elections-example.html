<p>Every four years there are new local elections in Portugal - the next will be in a couple of months. For a new Portuguese local election event there should be a new <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q120913144">wikidata item</a>... only these election events actually have distinct (municipal) local elections, 308 of them. That means, the local election item has (or should have) 308 parts. How to create them?</p>

<p>This is what I did for the 2025 elections. It's quite probably not the best way to do this, but it got the task done:</p>

<ol>
<li>I created <a href="https://w.wiki/EtZF">a query</a> looking at the parts of the 2021 elections. I saved the output and changed the names, replacing 2021 to 2025 - and that gave me a list of all the new items I had to create;</li>
<li>I took the list of items names and turned it into a <a href="qs-local-elections.csv">quickstatements csv file</a> - not only stating the names of the items I wanted to create, but also adding a very basic set of properties to them. I ran it through <a href="https://quickstatements.toolforge.org">the online tool</a>, 308 items were created;</li>
<li>I made a <a href="https://w.wiki/EtZb">new query</a> to have a list of these 308 items that were created, and saved its output because we now need to add them as parts of the 2025 elections item;</li>
<li>created that <a href="qs-add-items-as-parts.csv">new quickstatements csv</a> saying that the 2025 elections had as a part each of those new items, and ran it.</li>
</ol>

<p>PS: I did this, possibly better, for the 2021 elections. I should have documented what I did but I didn't do it, and for 2025 at the begining I didn't even recall that I had been the one doing it for 2021. So, this blog post will hopefully help me know what I will need to do in 2029... but I hope it might also be useful to others, for similar tasks.</p>

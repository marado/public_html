musical endeavours

It has come to my attention that "my worlds don't cross" - many people who know
me for some activities have no idea I delve in anothers. In particular, plenty
of people don't know I'm a musician.

Of course, it is quite probable that those also don't read this blog (who
does?), but in any case, I felt compelled to write this short blog post to talk
about two of musical projects - and how can you support me by adding their
albums to your collection.

My main focus for more than a decade has been on
[kokori](https://kokori.grogue.org), a post-cyberpunk industrial duo that you
can sample [on this youtube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ggGrQOiqN8&list=PL6e2XQAkf_eoCOhyQqBmKue5_pmAMv2Z7)
that showcases several songs from our full-length album 'rootkit' - an album
that you can [buy on CD](https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/27295098).

A distinct project is [Qink](https://qink.grogue.org/), and **Q**ink **i**s
**n**ot **k**okori. Instead, it is meant to be "the final inorganic ambient to
your darkest needs", the soundtrack to your horror show. You can [listen to its
album](https://metaphysicalcircuits.bandcamp.com/album/dies-ist-nicht-witte-dood)
or even purchase its [cassette tape
edition](https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/1051619153).

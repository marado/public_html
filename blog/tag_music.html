<p>It has come to my attention that "my worlds don't cross" - many people who know
me for some activities have no idea I delve in anothers. In particular, plenty
of people don't know I'm a musician.</p>

<p>Of course, it is quite probable that those also don't read this blog (who
does?), but in any case, I felt compelled to write this short blog post to talk
about two of musical projects - and how can you support me by adding their
albums to your collection.</p>

<p>My main focus for more than a decade has been on
<a href="https://kokori.grogue.org">kokori</a>, a post-cyberpunk industrial duo that you
can sample <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ggGrQOiqN8&amp;list=PL6e2XQAkf_eoCOhyQqBmKue5_pmAMv2Z7">on this youtube
playlist</a>
that showcases several songs from our full-length album 'rootkit' - an album
that you can <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/27295098">buy on CD</a>.</p>

<p>A distinct project is <a href="https://qink.grogue.org/">Qink</a>, and <strong>Q</strong>ink <strong>i</strong>s
<strong>n</strong>ot <strong>k</strong>okori. Instead, it is meant to be "the final inorganic ambient to
your darkest needs", the soundtrack to your horror show. You can <a href="https://metaphysicalcircuits.bandcamp.com/album/dies-ist-nicht-witte-dood">listen to its
album</a>
or even purchase its <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/1051619153">cassette tape
edition</a>.</p>

<p>Celebrating the shortest?/longest? night (depending on where you are in the
world), this year's Club Tidal solsice party is going to be a
<a href="https://sun.tidalcycles.org/">24 hours festival</a>, and my solo musical project
<a href="https://merankorii.blogspot.com/">Merankorii</a> is going to participate by
playing Cycle #35 (if you're in Portugal, that will be at 21:20, on December
21).</p>

<p>As some of you know, Yule is when my birthday also is, so this is a special
celebration for me...</p>

<p>This online festival is going to be live streamed, so make sure to tune in
during this 24h period and celebrate the Solstice by witnessing to people from
all over the world livecoding sounds for your pleasure! </p>

Are Cassette tapes dead? (again)

<p>Tired of reading people saying that one or another mature technology was dead,
ten years ago I decided to act upon one of those claims (saying that cassette
tapes were dead) and <a href="https://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/2011/05/stop-claiming-is-dead.html">write a blog
post</a>,
where, using the data available on Discogs, I made a graph showing the
percentage of cassette releases related to all of the releases on that
database.</p>

<p>That blog post had more success than I thought would have, with some people,
once in a while, wondering how were things progressing (not only regarding the
cassette tapes market on current days, but also the growth of discogs' database
and its knowledge of past releases). I did update the graph a few times since
the initial blog post, but today, to mark the 10th anniversary of the initial
post, I decided to <a href="https://github.com/marado/discogs-tape-releases">actually write a script that automatically generates such a
graphic</a>, and generate one of
those graphs, once again.</p>

<p>And, guess what!, turns out cassette tapes aren't dead, or even dying.</p>
